# How I made my Website

Hello Hello! By the fact that you are here, I take it that you are interested in web-development and in particular – how this website was made. No worries, because hopefully, after you finish reading this short lil' article, you will have some ideas on where to start building your own. Also, please feel free to check out my [website](https://darianlmj.herokuapp.com).

*Disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at this, everything that is written here is based on my own personal experiences. I am still learning more about front-end web development.*

Just before we get into the rest of this article, I wanted to give you a brief overview about this website. Before the whole website built commenced, I had no prior experience. The only things I did know was some basic HTML and CSS syntax but that was pretty much it. Naturally, I opted to start out with an old school way of building websites, which were by using the following languages:


## Languages Used

- Reactjs
- HTML
- CSS

However, as I started to get more experience and discovering new and better ways of making this project easier, I decided to start over by switching to a JavaScript library called **Reactjs** to make this website cause I've heard that it makes life easier in the long run. But don't worry, there's actually plenty of similarities in the syntax if you take a look at the source code.

## Websites Used

For those of you who are keen on starting your web development journey, here are a few lists of the various websites I drew the inspiration for this website from. Whether it's "how to format things a certain way" or "how to change the colour of this"; there are always tons of help out there and this is just represents a small subset of that. Just keep in mind that a large majority of building this website was just Google-ing things that I didn't know how to do (like literally 80% of it) so if I can do it — you can too!
