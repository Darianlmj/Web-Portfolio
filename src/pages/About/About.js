                            That little ball of fluff in the picture above is Max. <br/> 
                            He's a sand-coloured Cavoodle who we've adopted back in 2020 and <br/>
                            the reason 80% of my phone's camera storage is used up. <br/>
                            He's a waskly wittle pupper who loves belly rubs, hiding his <br/>
                            bone-shaped food and sleeps like a human. His favourite things to <br/>
                            play with are ping-pong balls, tennis balls, and weirdly enough &#8212; <br/>
                            empty toilet rolls. You know the little  brown cylinders when a toilet roll <br/>
                            has been used up... that. <br/>

                            You might be wondering what's with the weird looking planet <br/>
                            in the Home page, well, that's mainly because I'm bad at graphic design. <br/>
                            But the other reason is because I love space and all things astronomy. <br/>
                            I'm not talking about liking stars and planets and all that just because <br/>
                            they look cool, I'm talking about actual astrophysics. Fun fact, before <br/>
                            I started on my Computer Science journey, I actually applied to study <br/> 
                            Astrophysics in the UK. But one thing led to  another and I ended up not<br/>
                            being able to pursue it. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Now I just resign myself to watching old Richard Feynman lectures on <br/>
                            Youtube and reading about dark matter and quasars in books.

                            Anyone who knows me knows that I love watching US sitcoms. <br/>
                            Name any show, I will bet you I have
                            watched it. From Modern Family, <br/>
                            Two and a Half Men, 2 Broke Girls, Brooklyn Nine-Nine; to lesser <br/>
                            known ones like 8 Simple Rules and Everybody Hates Chris just to <br/>
                            name a few. I have watched them all to a point where I can actually <br/>
                            recite lines from any given episode. <br/>
                            <br/>

                            This is where my taste in music varies a lot compared to others. <br/>
                            While some prefer EDM, Metal or Pop Rock &#8212; I prefer musicals. <br/>
                            And no, I'm not just talking about only liking the songs, I actually <br/> 
                            love watching it for the plot. Some say that musical theater is boring <br/> 
                            or  that it makes no sense, but to me, I think that it's a really underrated<br/> 
                            art form. It literally takes a triple threat to be able to pull off a convincing<br/> 
                            show. <br/> 
                            <br/> 
                            If you are familiar with musicals like Hairspray, DEH (not the movie) and<br/> 
                            Funny Girl, we have much to talk about.
